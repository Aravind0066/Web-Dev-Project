A project Creating in my Second year of college 

Campus Resource Locator

Campus Resource Locator is a web-based application that helps students find and share information about campus resources such as classrooms, Wi-Fi zones, restrooms, and essential facilities. The platform includes a live campus feed, student queries, and a centralized essentials section, with a clean and consistent user interface designed for clarity and usability. This project was developed as part of an academic Web Development and DBMS course to demonstrate frontend design, structured data handling, and system-level thinking.
